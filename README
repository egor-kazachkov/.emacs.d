Emacs as IDE. How to install custom Emacs and set it up as IDE.
Notes for self-use.

Get latest version from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/ 
Currently it is 24.3

For Linux:
  cd /opt/src
  wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-24.3.tar.gz
  tar xzf emacs-24.3.tar.gz 
  rm *tar.gz
  cd emacs-24.3

Configure options that are omitted but may be important:
--enable-locallisppath=PATH (because I intend to keep all lisp code
in home dir); bunch of options related to e-mail retreival (I don't
use emacs as e-mail client for now). Most other options are enabled by
default - I disabled only gif support. I also installed libxpm-dev
needed for Xpm support. You may need other developers packages if you
don't have them installed. 

  sudo apt-get install libxpm-dev
  ./configure --prefix=/opt --with-x-toolkit=gtk2 --with-x --with-gif=no
  make
  make install

For Windows: just install binary package

Now lets setup Emacs from scratch. First of all I want to keep all 
emacs-related stuff in one place and under version control. Lets it
be ~/.emacs.d directory. For version control I will use github.com
(every self-respecting emacser should have his .emacs on github!) So
create .emacs.d repo on github and then:

  cd ~
  mkdir .emacs.d
  touch .emacs.d/.emacs
  ln -s .emacs.d/.emacs .emacs

We need symbol link .emacs in home dir so Emacs could find it on
startup. But real .emacs config will be kept under .emacs.d so we
could version control it too. 

  cd .emacs.d
  git init
  git add .emacs 
  git commit -m "initial commit"
  git remote add origin https://github.com/egor-kazachkov/.emacs.d.git
  git push -u origin master

Beside stuff which is worth to put in git, .emacs.d will keep
different files not worth it: backup saves, history, file positions,
etc. So we want to add them to .gitignore. Also I want to keep this
how-to for future reference so I put it into README and also add it to
git. 

  touch .gitignore
  touch README
  echo "cache/*" >.gitignore
  git add .gitignore README
  git commit -m "added .gitignore README"
  git push -u origin master

Config part is completely in .emacs file, so you can look here.
